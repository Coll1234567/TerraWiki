### What is noise?

In Terra, noise does does not refer to sound you can hear, but rather a series of [randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)* generated values. These values are produced by something *we will call* a **noise function** - which is just a fancy algorithm that converts an input into a randomized numeric output.

```none
┌──────────────────┐    ┌────────────────┐    ┌───────────────────┐
│ Input parameters │ →  > Noise Function >  → │ Randomized output │
└──────────────────┘    └────────────────┘    │   (aka 'noise')   │
                                              └───────────────────┘
```

#### Why is noise important?

Noise is a central concept in Terra, because just about every random aspect of world generation is influenced by noise to some degree. Having a basic understanding of noise and how to manipulate it will give you insight into how worlds are randomly generated by Terra, and is an important skill to have if you want to develop your own config packs.

Before learning how to manipulate noise, you should first have an understanding of the underlying concepts outlined here. Don't worry, we won't throw anything *too complicated* at you for now! Having a firm grasp on noise will bring you closer to controlling exactly how world generation will behave, which is why having a foundational understanding is important.

Here is just a short of list of things heavily influenced by noise in Terra:

* The placement of biomes in the world.
* How terrain is shaped.
* How flora and trees are distributed.


### Noise Basics

Here we will cover some key points is grasping noise in Terra. If you feel like certain concepts are too difficult to understand, feel free to skim over them for now, and revisit them later.

#### Demonstration

Let's begin with a demonstration which will display the most basic process of 'creating' noise. We will use a theoretical implementation of a noise function called [*white noise*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise), and generate some values with it. Explaining how exactly our *white noise* function creates these values is outside the scope of this guide, however is not essential in understanding the general idea.

 We will perform a couple samples with our function, using numbers 1 - 10 as an input, and record the outputs as both a number and a shade from black to white (where -1 is black, and 1 is white). We will also round the output to one decimal place for simplicity. *(Typical outputs will produce decimals with **much higher** precision than just one decimal place!)*

###### MODEL

```none
┌────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐
│  Input parameters  │ → > White Noise > → │ Randomized output │
├────────────────────┤   │   Function  │   └───────────────────┘
│ Number from 1 - 10 │   └─────────────┘
└────────────────────┘
```

###### RESULTS

<img src="images/noise/basic_example-01.png" alt="10 samples of white noise" width="75%">

Simple, right? All our noise function does is convert one value to another. You can think of noise functions like a little number machine, that takes an input and scrambles it around to produce an output.

#### Determinism

One requirement of Terra noise functions is that the output must be *deterministic*, meaning given any input, the output must always be the same. This means we can reliably re-produce any 'random' results we get from noise functions by feeding it the same input.

Going off the results above, when passing the number `5` to our *white noise* function, we will always get the number `0.4` back.

#### Seeds

Sometimes, we want to use the same input, and same noise function, but for multiple random unique outputs. In that case, we can use a seed in our noise function. Seeds are basically a way of getting a whole new uncorrelated set of random values from the same inputs + noise function.

Expanding on our basic model of noise generation we have:

```none
┌──────────────────┐   ┌────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐
│ Input parameters │ → > Noise Function > → │ Randomized output │
├──────────────────┤   └────────────────┘   └───────────────────┘
│ - Seed           │
│ - Input value    │
└──────────────────┘
```

Here is a basic example using two different seeds to produce different outputs, using the same inputs and noise function from the example above.

<img src="images/noise/basic_example-02.png" alt="10 samples of white noise" width="75%">

One example of using seeds that you might be familiar with is the minecraft world seed. A vanilla minecraft world seed gets inserted into the many different noise functions that govern vanilla world generation, resulting in completely different worlds per seed, since each noise function will return a completely new set of values.

###### VANILLA BEDROCK GENERATION TRIVIA

> Some noise functions in vanilla generation use the same seed for every world (meaning they don't factor in the world seed), which can result in every world generating a certain characteristic the exact same way. One notable example - the function that controls bedrock formation uses a static seed for every world, leading every vanilla generated world  to share the same random configuration of bedrock.

Within Terra world generation, all* noise functions use a combination of the world seed and a value called **salt**, to determine its own seed. Salt is a number you specify when defining noise configurations, and simply gets added to the world seed. This allows individual noise configurations to use new sets of output values, while sharing the same base noise function.

#### Flavors of Noise

There are many different variants and implementations of noise functions, such as our *white noise* function above. Each has their own quirks, behaviours, and applications, however in general they all follow the same basic principles outlined here. We will cover a couple of these variants later down the line.

Here is a small list of notable noise functions that are commonly used in Terra:

* Simplex Noise
* Cellular / Voronoi / Worley Noise
* White Noise
* Value Noise

#### Multidimensional Noise

The phrase 'multidimensional noise' may sound intimidating, but don't worry, it's a fairly simple concept to understand. Simply put, multidimensional noise involves providing **multiple** input values, rather than just one. In every example thus far, we have only provided one value for each noise *'sample'* (excluding the seed), meaning we are conceptually only sampling in one dimension, however we can go further.

The simplest example of multidimensional noise is just adding one extra input to our noise function, for a grand total of 2 inputs. Conveniently, that gives us 2 dimensions, thus we can easily display a set of 2D samples in a grid. We will refer to the first input as `X`, and the second as `Z`.

In a new example, lets use a range of 1 - 3 for both `X` and `Z`, giving us a total of 9 samples (3 x 3). We will only label the `X` & `Z` axes, as well the reference point `X=0`, `Z=0` for the sake of simplicity.

###### TWO DIMENSIONAL MODEL

```none
┌──────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐
│ Input parameters │ → > White Noise > → │ Randomized output │
├──────────────────┤   │   Function  │   ├───────────────────┤
│ - Seed           │   └─────────────┘   │ Displayed as as a │
| - Input 1 (X)    |                     │ 2D grid of shades │
| - Input 2 (Z)    |                     └───────────────────┘
└──────────────────┘
```

###### RESULTS

<img src="images/noise/basic_example-03.png" alt="10 samples of white noise" width="25%">

As you can see, all we have done is add another dimension to our white noise function, allowing for noise to be depicted as a 2D grid, rather than a list of values.

Taking this experiment further, lets use a larger sample size. This time we will sample a grid of 64 x 64 points, where each sample will be represented as a single pixel.

<img src="images/noise/whitenoise64x64.png" alt="10 samples of white noise" width="25%">

What we have done here is essentially produced a random image using our *white noise* function.

By default, we will assume the above format of visualizing noise in 2D as an image, where left-to-right represents our `X` input, and up-to-down represents our `Z` input.

###### HIGHER DIMENSIONS

Many noise algorithms support an arbitrary amount of inputs, meaning that we can sample noise in any number of dimensions. Typically, we will only use up to three dimensions, as we are three dimensional beings, however noise inputs don't always represent spatial dimensions. One application of 

#### Thresholding

[Thresholding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thresholding_(image_processing)) in this context refers to segmenting an input value into several parts based on which defined range that input value fits in to. This is not a concept specific to noise, but is something to keep in mind, as it is commonly used in conjunction with noise and world generation.

A simple example of a thresholding function would be outputting a value of `-1` for input values less than `0`, and outputting a value of `1` for every other input, however the output could be anything, such as `true / false` depending on use.

Applying a threshold to every pixel of an image where `input = intensity of the pixel`, `output = either a black or white pixel`, and `threshold = 50%`, we get the following result:

<img src="images/noise/threshold_example.png" alt="Side by side comparison of an image being thresholded" width="100%">

###### AS A MATH FUNCTION

> We can represent a basic example of thresholding mathematically as a [piecewise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piecewise) function:
> ```
> f(x) =
> {
>   -1   if   x <  threshold
>    1   if   x >= threshold
> }
> ```
> Most applications of thresholding are essentially fancy piecewise functions written programmatically.

Thresholding is a useful concept to understand when combined with noise, as it allows for functionality such as splitting noise functions into distinct values. We will cover an exampled of thresholded noise and an application of it in the following section.

#### Applying Noise to World Generation

You might be wondering: *How does this information translate to generating an entire world?* Before we jump straight from simple noise generation to generating entire worlds, lets just keep it simple and apply the knowledge we've covered thus far to a simple application.

###### PLANTING GRASS

Lets say we have a flat square of grass blocks in our world, and we want to generate some grass on it. How would we determine where grass goes? Well we can use our *white noise* function for that!

The first thing we will want to do is feed our *X & Z world coordinates & seed* into our *2D white noise* function, which will give us a randomized output value (from -1 to 1 as discussed) for every X-Z column for any given world seed. We will then use that output value to determine whether we place some grass or not. The way this will be determined is by simply [thresholding](#thresholding) it! For now lets use a threshold of `0`, where any value below our threshold will mean `place grass`.

###### GRASS PLACEMENT MODEL

```none
┌──────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌───────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Input parameters │ → > White Noise > → │ Randomized output │ → >   Threshold Function    │
├──────────────────┤   │   Function  │   ├───────────────────┤   ├─────────────────────────┤
│ - World Seed     │   └─────────────┘   │   A value from    │   │ If below the threshold, │
| - X Coordinate   │                     │     -1 to 1       │   │ place grass. (Displayed │
| - Z Coordinate   │                     └───────────────────┘   │   as a green pixel)     │
└──────────────────┘                                             └─────────────────────────┘
```

###### RESULTS

<img src="images/noise/grass_64x64_50pcthreshold.png" alt="64 x 64 distribution of grass placement" width="30%">

As you can see, we now have a method of randomly determining where grass goes for any given X-Z coordinate in any world. We can even reduce / increase how much grass we get by modifying our threshold value:

`Threshold = -0.25`

<img src="images/noise/grass_64x64_25pcthreshold.png" alt="64 x 64 distribution of grass placement, with a lower threshold" width="30%">

*Lowering* the threshold from `0` to `-0.25` results in less grass because we are effectively removing the values between `-0.25` and `0` from falling below the threshold. Conversely, *increasing* the threshold will result in more grass, as more values will fall below the threshold.

This is just one of many applications of noise in world generation.

### Coherent Noise

Thus far, we have only covered noise that outputs seemingly random tv-static-like values, which is fine for simple applications like the grass example above. But how can noise produce smooth rolling hills, vast mountains, and other structured random generation? Lets place the white noise function under the category **Random Noise**, and introduce a new category of noise functions called **Coherent Noise**.

###### WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

The main difference that separates Random Noise from Coherent Noise is that 

#### Simplex Noise
Simplex is a gradient noise function created by Ken Perlin to address the limitations in his older noise function,
Perlin noise. Simplex is more performant than Perlin noise, especially in higher dimensions, and has fewer artifacts.
Terra uses redistributed, normalized Simplex noise for [biome selection](./Biome-Selection).
Here's an example of Simplex noise:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VyJmIfL.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   
Each point on the image has a grayscale value equal to the value of the noise function at the image coordinates.
As you can see, the values are pseudorandom, yet gradients exist between them.

##### Frequency
Frequency is the amount that changes in coordinates affect changes in noise levels. Essentially, frequency can be
thought of as "zooming" th noise in or out. Here are some examples:

* Frequency: 0.005:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VyJmIfL.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   

* Frequency: 0.01:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yJQc3y2.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>  

* Frequency: 0.02:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZAhpq4y.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   



As the frequency increases, the noise "zooms out," resulting in faster changes.
##### Simplex Fractal Noise
In some applications, Simplex noise is too smooth to produce "realistic" results. Looking at the images above, you may
notice that they are quite "blobby." In some cases, more randomness is desirable. This is where Simplex Fractal noise
is useful. Simplex Fractal noise stacks a number of Simplex noise functions at different frequencies on top of each
other, to produce a noisier result.

* 1 Octave:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/VyJmIfL.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   

* 2 Octaves:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3rL2vs9.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   

* 3 Octaves:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/3rL2vs9.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   

* 4 Octaves:   
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/JDkFc8l.png" alt="Simplex Noise" width="200"/>   



Remember that the number of octaves is the number of noise functions stacked on top of each other, and each additional
function has a lower frequency, and is weighted lower.   
Terra uses Simplex Fractal noise for erosion and terrain generation.
